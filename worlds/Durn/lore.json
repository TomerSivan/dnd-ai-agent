    "lore": "Durn is a mystical region shrouded in perpetual twilight, where the sky is painted in hues of indigo and violet, and the stars are visible even during the day. The region is infamous for its vast, enchanted forests, known as the Gloomwood, where ancient trees whisper secrets in a language long forgotten by all but the oldest of scholars. Durn is home to a myriad of magical creatures and beings, including the elusive Faenan, ethereal beings said to be the guardians of the forest. Deep within the heart of the Gloomwood lies the Twilight Sanctuary, a sacred grove said to pulse with the primal energies of the world itself. The people of Durn live in harmony with nature, developing a culture deeply rooted in the cycles of the land and the mysterious energies surrounding them. Their society is guided by the Council of Elders, a group of revered seers who interpret the will of the gods through the patterns of the stars. Legends speak of an ancient artifact hidden within the depths of Durn, the Celestial Mirror, rumored to grant visions of past and future to those deemed worthy. The region is often visited by scholars and adventurers from far lands, drawn by the allure of its mysteries and the promise of knowledge and power. However, the paths through Durn are treacherous and ever-changing, and only those with pure intentions can truly navigate its enigmatic terrain."
